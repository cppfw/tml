A lightweight markup language C++ library.

The idea is that the document is just a tree of strings. Each string can have a number of children strings or no children at all, an so on.

document example:
```
"a string"
string_without_spaces
"string with children"{
	"child 1"
	Child2
	"child three"{
		SubChild1
		"Subchild two"

		Property1 {Value1}
		"Property two" {"Value 2"}
		// comment

		/* multi line
		   comment */

		// single line comment should have whitespace
		// before double slash //, otherwise it is not treated as comment.
		// This is in order to make possible URLs as unquoted strings:
		http://website.com/some/url

		"Escape sequences inside single double quotes: \" \n \r \t \\ \/"

		// C++-style raw string
		R"qwerty(raw string content " """ { } \ / )qwerty"
		
		// python-style raw string
		"""bla bla {} "" and "quoted" bla bla"""
	}
}
```
